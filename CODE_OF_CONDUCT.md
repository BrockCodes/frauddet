# Code of Conduct, Threat Model, and Comprehensive Risk Assessment

Leonard Governmental Investigative Toolkit (frauddet)

This project exists within domains that intersect with public trust, investigative activity, regulatory oversight, fraud examination, consumer protection, vulnerable and historically marginalized populations, financial risk environments, public sector resource allocation, safety-critical oversight workflows, and decision-adjacent analytical processes where outputs may influence institutional perception, case triage, workload routing, prioritization sequences, or early-warning review contexts.

It may be deployed in environments including, but not limited to:
	•	childcare licensing and youth-serving program oversight
	•	healthcare, behavioral health, and allied care regulatory review
	•	shelters, transitional housing, and humanitarian service facilities
	•	nonprofit and charitable activity monitoring
	•	public benefit eligibility and compliance environments
	•	education, workforce, and credentialing program oversight
	•	procurement, vendor integrity, and grant administration
	•	environmental and safety inspection prioritization
	•	municipal, county, state, and inter-agency coordination contexts
	•	fraud prevention, consumer protection, and risk-mitigation initiatives

Because the Software may influence workflows with human impact and welfare implications, all contributors, maintainers, evaluators, authorized users, research partners, policy analysts, auditors, contractors, and commercial licensees are expected to operate under the highest standards of:
	•	ethical discipline
	•	professional restraint
	•	confidentiality stewardship
	•	due-process awareness
	•	harm-reduction discipline
	•	interpretive caution

This toolkit must be treated as high-impact regulatory-adjacent infrastructure, not a generic analytics convenience tool, experimentation sandbox, or reputational-classification system.

This Code of Conduct includes an integrated:
	•	threat model
	•	deployment governance doctrine
	•	operational risk-assessment framework
	•	lifecycle accountability model
	•	interpretive discipline standard
	•	adverse-impact mitigation baseline

Negligent, reckless, deceptive, or malicious misuse of investigative-adjacent technology can create:
	•	reputational or institutional credibility damage
	•	false, premature, or speculative investigative inferences
	•	discriminatory or disparate practical outcomes
	•	structural bias reinforcement or selection effects
	•	misinterpretation by untrained or non-specialist operators
	•	legal, evidentiary, and administrative complications
	•	coercive or retaliatory misuse in organizational contexts
	•	chilling effects on legitimate providers and whistleblowers
	•	erosion of trust between stakeholders and oversight bodies
	•	material harm to individuals, families, staff, or institutions

Participation in, contribution to, or operational use of this Software constitutes acceptance of these expectations. If you cannot comply with this Code and the License, you must not use, deploy, modify, integrate, resell, or embed this Software.

1. Purpose, Scope, Mission Alignment, and Guiding Principles

The project supports responsible, lawful, explainable, auditable, and human-validated investigative and oversight workflows. Intended functions include:
	•	early-signal triage and anomaly indication
	•	structured investigative review support
	•	contextual cross-reference and enrichment
	•	workload sequencing and prioritization hygiene
	•	risk-adjacent analytical transparency
	•	accountability and internal quality-of-service review
	•	pattern recognition across filings and historical records
	•	consistency in case screening interpretation
	•	institutional learning and retrospective review capacity

The system is designed to augment professional human judgment, not replace it, not narrow discretion, and not substitute evidentiary standards.

It assumes operators who have:
	•	investigative literacy and evidentiary discipline
	•	training in due-process and administrative fairness
	•	sector-specific policy and regulatory awareness
	•	understanding of algorithmic uncertainty and ambiguity
	•	awareness of bias risk and outcome disparity potential
	•	capacity to interpret outputs proportionally and contextually

The Software is not intended to:
	•	automate enforcement or adjudicative determination
	•	serve as conclusive proof or case justification
	•	publish lists, rankings, labels, or exposure artifacts
	•	operate as a risk-grading or creditworthiness engine
	•	function as a surveillance pipeline
	•	support coercive targeting or adversarial monitoring
	•	enable predictive-punishment or pre-crime inference
	•	substitute for incident investigation or professional reasoning
	•	justify action without corroboration and documented review

The system produces:
	•	signals, not judgments
	•	indicators, not determinations

Responsible use is a mandatory operational condition.

2. Community Standards and Behavioral Expectations

All maintainers, contributors, evaluators, researchers, users, and licensees must adhere to the following expectations.

2.1 Professional Conduct and Respectful Engagement

Participants will:
	•	engage constructively and analytically
	•	respect contextual nuance and legal boundaries
	•	separate critique of design from critique of persons
	•	avoid inflammatory or politicized rhetoric
	•	recognize that collaborators may operate under constraints

Participants must not:
	•	harass, demean, ridicule, or intimidate others
	•	pressure investigative outcomes through discussion
	•	present outputs as rulings or certified determinations
	•	misrepresent credentials, authority, or institutional role
	•	weaponize discussion to influence real-world outcomes

Violation may result in removal and license consequence.

2.2 Anti-Harassment, Non-Targeting, and Exposure Prohibitions

Participants may not:
	•	publish identifying details of individuals or small organizations
	•	derive or expose personal identifiers from outputs
	•	coordinate reputational or harassment campaigns
	•	create shadow lists, rumor indexes, or informal blacklists
	•	upload screenshots or logs containing identifiers
	•	repurpose outputs for media narratives or pressure tactics

These rules apply to:
	•	repository discussions
	•	forks and derivatives
	•	documentation
	•	external integrations

Any such conduct is a major violation.

2.3 Transparency of Role, Interest, and Stakeholder Position

Participants should disclose when relevant:
	•	whether acting as government, contractor, researcher, or vendor
	•	institutional affiliation
	•	limits of policy authority
	•	conflicts of interest
	•	financial or commercial interests

Misrepresentation of mandate or jurisdiction is prohibited.

3. Ethical Deployment, Safeguards, and Operational Conditions

The Software may only be used where:
	•	lawful authority or legitimate investigative basis exists
	•	human review operates at every consequential decision gate
	•	outputs are interpreted with corroborating evidence
	•	affected parties retain procedural recourse where applicable
	•	governance structures authorize and supervise use
	•	privacy and retention obligations are upheld
	•	safeguards exist to prevent misuse escalation

The Software must not be used to:
	•	automate adverse eligibility or enforcement decisions
	•	facilitate retaliation or reputational targeting
	•	support politically selective outcomes
	•	create exclusionary filters or social-sorting systems
	•	pre-select punitive targets
	•	substitute interpretation for investigation
	•	suppress critics or whistleblowers

Deployment becomes non-compliant when it:
	•	bypasses human interpretation
	•	treats indicators as conclusive proof
	•	creates disparate outcome patterns
	•	shifts enforcement weighting without review
	•	conceals operational intent or presence

Such conditions may trigger enforcement or revocation.

3.1 Heightened-Sensitivity Contexts

Elevated ethical caution is required in:
	•	childcare and youth-serving environments
	•	behavioral and mental health services
	•	disability support programs
	•	emergency shelters and humanitarian facilities
	•	workforce and educational opportunity pipelines
	•	nonprofit and community-service contexts

Screening outputs must never:
	•	replace incident investigation
	•	bypass response or clarification opportunity
	•	form permanent record basis without review
	•	be used to infer future behavior

3.2 Prohibited Misuse Scenarios

Examples include:
	•	generating “high-risk provider” dashboards or lists
	•	embedding outputs in ranking or exclusion systems
	•	exporting indicators into consumer databases
	•	presenting outputs as investigative findings to media
	•	pre-flagging entities for punitive action cycles
	•	conditioning access to essential services on outputs

4. Responsibilities of Contributors, Maintainers, and Collaborators

Contributors modifying:
	•	rule heuristics or thresholds
	•	enrichment or correlation logic
	•	data transformation pipelines
	•	interpretive framing or documentation
	•	deployment configuration guidance
	•	export, lineage, or metadata structures

bear elevated ethical responsibility.

Design decisions must prioritize harm-reduction discipline.

4.1 Engineering and Design Risk Controls

Contributors must:
	•	avoid bias-amplifying inference patterns
	•	document assumptions and edge cases
	•	maintain interpretability and traceability
	•	ensure diagnostic and reconstruction capability
	•	treat false-positive risk as an ethical surface
	•	expose uncertainty and failure expectations

Outputs must remain:
	•	explainable
	•	reconstructable
	•	reviewable
	•	defensible in oversight contexts

4.2 Accountability Cannot Be Delegated

Contributors may not assume:
	•	institutional maturity mitigates fragile design
	•	documentation prevents misuse
	•	legal review eliminates risk
	•	training guarantees interpretive discipline

Responsibility is shared across:
	•	authors
	•	maintainers
	•	implementers
	•	derivative operators

4.3 Documentation and Disclosure Requirements

All feature or rule changes must include:
	•	intended scope and boundaries
	•	uncertainty and risk caveats
	•	dataset quality expectations
	•	recommended safeguards
	•	sectors where use is inappropriate

5. Third-Party Modifications, Extensions, and Liability Boundaries

Any party who:
	•	alters scoring or logic
	•	embeds the Software in operational systems
	•	deploys via SaaS or internal platforms
	•	extends export or correlation pipelines
	•	adds automated inference or triage layers

explicitly acknowledges:
	•	independent operational responsibility
	•	liability for downstream outcomes
	•	absence of Author indemnification

Derivative operators must disclose that:
	•	they control configuration and interpretation
	•	results are screening indicators only
	•	the Author does not endorse behavior

6. Integrated Threat Model and Risk Surface

Threat categories include:
	•	human behavioral misuse
	•	organizational governance failure
	•	contextual loss and metadata removal
	•	privacy inference reconstruction
	•	mission creep and scope inflation
	•	chain-of-custody collapse
	•	reputational coercion or misuse

Each vector requires monitoring and mitigation.

7. Deployment Risk-Assessment and Justification Framework

Before deployment, organizations must assess:
	•	proportionality versus consequence exposure
	•	decision adjacency and impact level
	•	due-process integrity
	•	vulnerability group exposure
	•	potential disparate outcomes
	•	reviewer expertise and workload burden
	•	correction and recourse mechanisms

High-impact use requires:
	•	supervisory approval
	•	legal and ethics consultation
	•	chain-of-custody preservation
	•	written acceptance of responsibility

8. Governance, Auditability, and Lifecycle Controls

Every consequential use must preserve:
	•	_run_id lineage
	•	ruleset and code version state

	•	prohibit copy-paste deployment across sectors

Cross-context reuse without review is prohibited.

10. Access Control, Data Handling, and Retention Discipline

Organizations must:
	•	restrict access to trained personnel
	•	apply least-privilege controls
	•	prevent uncontrolled export propagation
	•	document retention and destruction schedules
	•	avoid cross-agency dataset commingling
	•	prohibit shadow database replication

11. Incident Reporting, Remediation, and Disclosure

Report immediately:
	•	discriminatory or retaliatory use
	•	automated adverse actions
	•	unlicensed embedding or commercialization
	•	metadata or chain-of-custody loss
	•	unauthorized export or replication
	•	inference-leak or redaction failure
