======================================================================
2. SCOPE OF LICENSE AND DEFAULT .GOV RESTRICTION
======================================================================

2.1 Default Scope (.gov only). By default, and unless the Author provides
     separate, explicit written permission, this License grants usage rights
     only to .gov Entities and their contractors operating solely in the
     scope of official governmental work and solely for governmental or
     public-interest investigative, regulatory, oversight, auditing, or
     consumer-protection purposes.

2.2 Non-Governmental Entities. Any use of the Software by non-.gov entities
     (including private companies, non-profits, universities, or individuals)
     requires prior written permission from the Author. Without such written
     permission or a separate commercial agreement, non-.gov entities have
     no rights under this License to use or distribute the Software and must
     not run, integrate, or bundle the Software in any system.

2.3 Internal Government Contractors. Government contractors may use the
     Software only:
     (a) under direction of a .gov Entity;
     (b) solely for the benefit of that .gov Entity; and
     (c) in accordance with the .gov Entity’s legal obligations and this
         License. Contractors may not claim independent commercial rights
         to the Software or Derivative Works created with it, and any rights
         they have terminate automatically when their governmental engagement
         ends.

2.4 Geographic Scope. This License is global in geographic scope, but all
     Users must comply with their local and applicable laws, regulations, and
     professional responsibilities regarding data protection, investigation,
     evidence, consumer protection, financial crimes enforcement, sanctions,
     export controls, and related domains.

2.5 Export, Sanctions, and Restricted Use. Use of the Software in countries,
     jurisdictions, or by persons subject to applicable sanctions or export
     controls may be prohibited. Users are solely responsible for ensuring
     compliance with all export control and sanctions laws and for refraining
     from any use that would cause the Author to be in violation of such
     laws or regulations.

2.6 No Implied Rights. No rights are granted by implication, estoppel, or
     otherwise except as expressly set forth in this License. Any rights not
     explicitly granted to the User are reserved by the Author.

2.7 Relationship to Other Agreements. If the User has a separate written
     agreement with the Author regarding the Software, and there is a direct
     conflict between that agreement and this License, the separate written
     agreement will control only to the extent of the conflict. All other
     provisions of this License remain in full force and effect.

======================================================================
3. PERMITTED USES
======================================================================

3.1 Governmental / Regulatory Use. Subject to this License, .gov Entities
     may:

         abuse, misconduct, or compliance issues;
     (c) use the Software as part of internal analytical workflows, evidence
         review, case-building, and early-warning systems;
     (d) generate reports and Investigative Outputs for internal use or for
         inclusion in official governmental processes, court filings, or
         regulatory referrals, subject to applicable law; and
     (e) incorporate outputs into policy analysis, oversight reporting, risk
         dashboards, and similar analytic workflows, provided all other
         conditions of this License are met.

3.2 Non-Commercial Public-Interest Use (By Permission). Subject to explicit
     written permission from the Author, academic institutions, non-profits,
     or public-interest organizations may use the Software for research,
     investigative journalism, public-interest investigations, or consumer-
     protection efforts. Such permission may be free or subject to additional
     terms, at the Author’s sole discretion, and may impose additional
     privacy, disclosure, or ethical requirements appropriate to the context.

3.3 Limited Internal Evaluation by Non-.gov Entities. With the Author’s
     explicit written evaluation grant, a non-.gov entity may use the
     Software internally and non-commercially, solely to:
     (a) evaluate its capabilities; and
     (b) determine whether to enter a commercial license.
     Any such evaluation license is time-limited, non-transferable, and
     may be revoked by the Author upon notice, and must not be used to
     deliver services or products to any third party.

3.4 Internal Modifications. Permitted Users (under Sections 2 and 3) may
     modify the Software for internal use, provided that:
     (a) this License remains attached to the modified Software;
     (b) all credits and notices of the Author are preserved;
     (c) volume, performance, or tuning changes do not alter the licensing
         conditions; and
     (d) any external distribution of modified versions complies with the
         restrictions in Sections 4, 5, and 6 and does not suggest that the
         modified Software is authored or endorsed by the Author.

3.5 Documentation, Training, and Process Integration. Permitted Users may
     create internal documentation, standard operating procedures, and
     training materials describing how to use the Software, provided that
     such materials:
     (a) clearly attribute the Software to the Author;
     (b) do not misrepresent the legal effect, scope, or warranties of the
         Software; and
     (c) make clear any internal policies or constraints that further limit
         the use of the Software within the User’s organization.

3.6 Backups and Archival Copies. Users may create a reasonable number of
     backup and archival copies of the Software for disaster recovery,
     continuity of operations, or legal archiving, provided that such copies
     remain subject to this License and are not used for purposes beyond
     those allowed herein.

======================================================================
4. PROHIBITED USES
======================================================================

4.1 No Harassment or Targeting. The Software and Investigative Outputs may
     not be used to:
     (a) harass, stalk, threaten, or intimidate any person;
     (b) dox or publish sensitive personal information without lawful and
         legitimate investigative necessity and appropriate legal authority;
     (c) incite public harassment, mobbing, vigilantism, or retaliation;
     (d) conduct personal vendettas, retaliatory campaigns, or politically
         motivated targeting divorced from legitimate investigative need;
     (e) systematically target whistleblowers, journalists, or protected
         classes in violation of applicable protections.

4.2 No Unlawful Discrimination. The Software may not be used to facilitate
     unlawful discrimination in access to public services, housing,
     education, lending, employment, or any other protected sphere,
     including but not limited to activities prohibited by civil-rights and
     fair-lending laws, equal protection principles, or analogous legal
     regimes in the User’s jurisdiction.

4.3 No Unauthorized Surveillance. The Software may not be used as part of
     unlawful or unauthorized surveillance, data harvesting, scraping, or
     monitoring, whether governmental or private, including activities that
     exceed statutory or regulatory authority, or violate contractual or
     technical access limitations placed on data sources.

4.4 No Unlicensed Commercial Use. Without separate written agreement or the
     default commercial terms in Section 5 being followed, Commercial Use and
     Bundled Use are prohibited. The mere absence of payment does not convert
     a use to non-commercial if it supports or facilitates a revenue-
     producing business, product, or service, or is used in the delivery of
     paid engagements of any kind.

4.5 No License Laundering. Users may not re-license, sublicense, or wrap the
     Software in another license to circumvent the restrictions, royalty
     obligations, or enforcement terms of this License, nor may Users
     represent to others that the Software is available under MIT, GPL,
     Apache, or other standard open-source terms.

4.6 No Misrepresentation of Origin. Users may not remove, obscure, or alter
     copyright notices, author credits, or license headers in a way that
     misrepresents the Software’s origin, authorship, or licensing terms.

4.7 No Use as Sole Automated Decision-Maker in Certain Domains. Unless
     expressly permitted by applicable law and accompanied by robust human
     review and oversight, the Software must not be used as the sole or
     primary automated basis for adverse decisions in High-Risk Domains,
     including decisions that deny or revoke housing, employment, healthcare,
     education, immigration benefits, or other essential services.

======================================================================
5. COMMERCIAL / BUNDLED USE AND ROYALTIES
======================================================================

5.1 Conditional Commercial License. Non-.gov entities and .gov Entities
     engaging in Commercial Use or Bundled Use must obtain a separate written
     commercial license from the Author or fall under the default commercial
     terms in this Section 5. In either case, commercial rights exist only to
     the extent expressly granted by the Author and may be narrowed, expanded,
     or conditioned upon additional obligations such as minimum fees, caps,
     or specific reporting formats.

5.2 Default Commercial Grant (Subject to Royalties). In the absence of a
     separate, negotiated commercial agreement, the Author conditionally
     grants a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, worldwide license
     to use, integrate, and bundle the Software for Commercial Use and
     Bundled Use, strictly conditioned upon:
     (a) compliance with all other terms of this License; and
     (b) payment of the royalties, reporting, and audit requirements set out
         in this Section 5.

5.3 Default Royalty Rate. For any Commercial Use or Bundled Use of the
     Software, the User agrees to pay the Author a royalty equal to **two
     percent (2%) of Gross Revenue** derived from any product, platform,
     service, or offering that incorporates, embeds, materially depends on,
     or is substantially enabled by the Software or its Derivative Works,
     regardless of whether the Software is visible or directly marketed to
     end users.

5.4 Example Commercial Scenarios (Non-Exhaustive). Royalties apply in,
     but are not limited to, the following scenarios:
     (a) A SaaS platform offering fraud screening, risk analytics, or
         investigative dashboards that use the Software;
     (b) A consulting firm using the Software as part of paid investigative
         or due diligence engagements, even if the Software is only used
         internally to develop recommendations;
     (c) A commercial product, toolkit, or API that exposes features powered
         in whole or in part by the Software;
     (d) A managed service that runs the Software on behalf of clients;
     (e) A commercial data product or marketplace offering risk scores,
         flags, or investigative indicators derived from the Software.

5.5 Revenue Attribution in Multi-Component Offerings. Where the Software is
     one component among others in a broader product or service, Gross
     Revenue must be reasonably allocated to reflect the value derived from
     functionality materially enabled by the Software. If the parties cannot
     agree on a reasonable allocation, the Author’s good-faith allocation,
     communicated in writing, shall control unless manifestly unreasonable.

5.6 Monthly Reporting and Payment. Users subject to royalties shall:
     (a) calculate owed royalties based on Gross Revenue on a monthly basis;
     (b) provide a brief but reasonably detailed revenue and royalty report
         to the Author within fifteen (15) days after the end of each
         calendar month; and
     (c) remit payment of the calculated royalty no later than thirty (30)
         days after month-end, via the payment channels designated by the
         Author, including wire transfer, ACH, or other mutually agreed
         method.

5.7 Contact and Payment Arrangements. Prior to any Commercial Use or
     Bundled Use, the User shall contact the Author to:
     (a) establish payment mechanisms and invoicing details;
     (b) confirm reporting formats and required level of detail;
     (c) clarify any edge cases regarding Gross Revenue attribution.
     Unless otherwise specified by the Author, initial contact shall be made
     via the email or communication channel indicated in the repository or
     associated documentation.

5.8 Audit Rights. The Author may, at reasonable intervals and upon reasonable
     written notice, request documentation or conduct (or have an independent
     auditor conduct) an audit reasonably necessary to verify revenue and
     royalty calculations related to the Software. If an audit reveals
     underpayment of more than five percent (5%) for any audited period, the
     User shall:
     (a) promptly pay all underpaid royalties;
     (b) pay interest as provided in Section 5.9; and
     (c) bear the reasonable costs of the audit, including auditor fees.

5.9 Late Payments. Late payments of royalties may accrue interest at the
     lesser of:
     (a) one percent (1%) per month; or
     (b) the maximum rate permitted by applicable law,
     from the date due until paid in full, compounded monthly where allowed.

5.10 No Royalty Waiver by Silence. Failure by the Author to immediately
      enforce royalty provisions, or temporary tolerance of non-payment, does
      not constitute a waiver of any right to royalties, enforcement, or other
      remedies, and does not estop the Author from later demanding full
      compliance for past or ongoing use.

5.11 Commercial Sub-licensing Restrictions. Users may not grant downstream
      licenses that omit or weaken the royalty obligations owed to the Author.
      Any attempt to grant a commercial sublicense that conflicts with this
      License is null and void, and may subject the User to injunctive relief
      and damages.

======================================================================
6. DISTRIBUTION AND REDISTRIBUTION
======================================================================

6.1 Redistribution to .gov Entities. Permitted Users may redistribute the
     Software to other .gov Entities, provided:
     (a) this License is included in full, unmodified form; and
     (b) the recipient is explicitly informed that the Software is licensed
         only under this custom license and is not standard open-source; and
     (c) the recipient agrees to be bound by this License before use.

6.2 Limited Developer Distribution. For development, testing, or integration
     purposes, a commercial User may share the Software with its employees
     and contractors who are bound by obligations no less protective than
     those in this License, solely as necessary to enable the User’s own
     permitted use, and only while such individuals remain engaged in that
     work.

6.3 No Public "Open Source" Re-Release. Users may not publicly re-release the
     Software under a different license (e.g., MIT, GPL, Apache) nor claim
     that the Software is open-source in the conventional sense. Any such
     attempt shall be void and may constitute copyright infringement and
     breach of contract.

6.4 Publication of Modifications and Forks. If you publish modifications,
     patches, forks, or Derivative Works based on the Software:
     (a) you must retain this License and all copyright notices;
     (b) you must clearly state that your work is derived from Software
         authored by the Author;
     (c) you may not relax or remove the .gov restrictions or the commercial
         royalty terms in any way; and
     (d) you must not imply that the Author endorses or supports your fork or
         Derivative Work.

======================================================================
8. INVESTIGATIVE & EVIDENTIARY DISCLAIMERS
======================================================================

8.1 Screening Only. The Software and its Investigative Outputs are screening
     tools and analytic signals only. They are not legal findings, final
     determinations, adjudications, or official accusations, and they do not
     by themselves establish liability, guilt, or regulatory violations.

8.2 Independent Verification. Users must independently verify any factual
     claims, risk assessments, or flags produced by the Software using
     appropriate investigative standards, public records, formal discovery,
     and professional judgment, before treating any output as reliable or
     acting on it in a consequential way, especially where significant rights,
     benefits, or obligations of individuals or entities are at stake.

8.3 No Automated Accusations. Investigative Outputs shall not be published as
     public accusations or claims of wrongdoing without:
     (a) human review;
     (b) appropriate contextualization; and
     (c) factual validation consistent with applicable investigative and
         evidentiary standards, including duty to disclose limitations,
         uncertainty, and potential sources of error.

8.4 No Legal Advice. The Software does not provide legal advice. Any legal
     conclusions drawn from use of the Software are solely the responsibility
     of the User and any legal counsel the User chooses to retain, and the
     Author is not responsible for any legal strategy, interpretation, or
     decision made by the User.

8.5 Evidentiary Use. If Investigative Outputs are used in legal or regulatory
     proceedings, Users are solely responsible for:
     (a) ensuring the outputs meet applicable evidentiary standards;

      to incorporate patches, pull requests, or other contributions from
      third parties into the official Software, such incorporation:
      (a) does not convert those contributors into licensors or warrantors to
          the User under this License; and
      (b) does not expand the Author’s liability for any prior or future use
          of third-party-modified versions outside the officially released
          Software.
