## Overview

This repository contains an investigative and fraud-screening toolkit authored by **Garrett Leonard**. It is designed for environments where investigative, regulatory, or oversight work intersects with:

- Childcare licensing and oversight  
- Healthcare & behavioral health providers  
- Housing, shelters, & transitional facilities  
- Education and private academy programs  
- Nonprofits receiving public funds  
- Contractors and third-party service providers to government agencies  

The system ingests provider-style organizational records, normalizes them, enriches them, and applies investigative heuristics to surface entities that may warrant human review, including:

- Shared addresses across unrelated entities  
- Thin or suspicious online presence  
- Reused or missing identifiers  
- Patterns suggesting shell entities or repeat serial actors  

Output formats include:

- JSON for investigative workflows & analytic dashboards  
- Optional CSV exports for auditors & inspectors  
- MongoDB collections tagged with run metadata for traceability

> This toolkit produces **investigative screening signals only** — not legal findings or accusations. Human verification is required.

## Core Capabilities

### Provider normalization
- Converts raw CSV / JSON / API input into a unified `Provider` model
- Handles missing or inconsistent field structures
- Provides a common cross-system comparison schema

### Investigative rules & heuristic scoring
- Centralized `signals` dictionary for diagnostic indicators
- Rules are intentionally explainable & auditable
- Outputs can be justified in regulatory or evidentiary contexts

### PII-aware serialization
- Supports **full internal records** and **redacted export profiles**
- Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive identifiers

### MongoDB persistence & run metadata
- Batch writes with configurable write modes
- Each run is tagged and reconstructable for audit review

### Dry-run & safe evaluation mode
- Enables training, sandboxing, and test pipelines
- Produces logs without persisting records

### Multi-sector investigative applicability
- Domain-agnostic core architecture
- License prohibits abusive, discriminatory, or retaliatory use

## Data Model: Provider Records

A simplified `Provider` model:

@dataclass
class Provider:
    id: str
    name: str
    address: Optional[str] = None
    phone: Optional[str] = None
    website: Optional[str] = None
    primary_email: Optional[str] = None
    latitude: Optional[float] = None
    longitude: Optional[float] = None
    signals: Dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)

Fields commonly treated as sensitive:
	•	Address
	•	Phone
	•	Email
	•	Website
	•	Coordinates

These may be automatically redacted depending on configuration.

Signals and Investigative Heuristics

Signals are structured analytic hints — not findings. Examples:

Address & identity indicators
	•	shared_address_count
	•	shared_phone_count
	•	known_maildrop_location

Online presence indicators
	•	has_website
	•	website_content_thin
	•	website_down_or_parked

Enforcement & history indicators
	•	prior_enforcement_matches
	•	associated_entities_count

Sector-specific flags (examples)

Childcare
	•	capacity_mismatch_with_space

Healthcare
	•	billing_pattern_flag

Housing
	•	frequent_evictions_flag

Flags are used to prioritize human review — not to conclude wrongdoing.

PII Handling & Redaction

This toolkit supports three standard export profiles:

Profile	Intended Use	PII State
Internal Investigative	Secure agency systems	Full data
Inter-Agency Sharing	Controlled partners	Redacted
Public Reporting	Transparency reports	Highly redacted

PII redaction applies to:
	•	address
	•	phone
	•	email
	•	website
	•	coordinates
	•	place identifiers

Redacted values are replaced with explicit placeholders.

Installation

Requirements:
	•	Python 3.10+
	•	Git
	•	Optional: MongoDB for persistence

git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/<repo>.git
cd <repo>

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

MongoDB Persistence

Documents are persisted with:
	•	_run_id
	•	_run_meta
	•	_schema_version
	•	_tag
	•	optional _deleted

Every run is independently reconstructable.

This enables:
	•	chain-of-custody style auditability
	•	historical comparison
	•	investigative repeatability

JSON / CSV Output

Exports are suitable for:
	•	forensic review
	•	dashboards
	•	data science workflows
	•	cross-agency reporting

Redaction state is preserved in output metadata.

Multi-Industry Use & Limitations

This toolkit is screening software, not:
	•	a legal adjudication system
	•	a benefits-eligibility engine
	•	a law enforcement determination tool

Outputs require:
	•	contextual analysis
	•	corroborating evidence
	•	professional judgment

Security, Ethics & Responsible Use

Use is prohibited for:
	•	harassment
	•	retaliation
	•	doxxing
	•	discrimination
	•	targeted harassment campaigns

Users must comply with:
	•	privacy + data protection law
	•	records handling requirements
	•	fair-process & due-process standards

This toolkit is explicitly designed to support:
	•	investigative due diligence
	•	consumer protection
	•	regulatory accountability
	•	public integrity workflows
